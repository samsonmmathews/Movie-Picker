# Movie Picker

Movie picker is a simple web project that gives the user movie suggestions based on their mood. A few movies will be stored for each predefined mood and a movie will be shown to the user based on the mood the user has selected. This is good for users who seem to have a hard time picking a movie to watch for any occasions.
